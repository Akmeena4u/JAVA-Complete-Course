In Java, procedural programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) represent two different paradigms for structuring and organizing code. Let's explore the differences between these two approaches:

### Procedural Programming:

1. **Structure:**
   - In procedural programming, the focus is on procedures or functions. Code is organized around procedures that perform specific tasks.

2. **Data and Functions:**
   - Data and functions are separate entities. Data is stored in variables, arrays, and structures, and functions manipulate this data.

3. **Global Data:**
   - Procedural programs often use global data that can be accessed and modified from any part of the program.

4. **Code Reusability:**
   - Code reuse is limited, and functions are typically used repeatedly across different parts of the program.

5. **Example (Procedural Style):**
   ```java
   // Procedural Style
   int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   int subtract(int a, int b) {
       return a - b;
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int num1 = 10;
       int num2 = 5;
       int sum = add(num1, num2);
       int difference = subtract(num1, num2);
       System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
       System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
   }
   ```

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Structure:**
   - OOP focuses on objects that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects interact with each other by invoking methods.

2. **Classes and Objects:**
   - Classes define the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are instances of classes that hold their own state and behavior.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation hides the internal state of objects and exposes only the necessary functionalities through methods.

4. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.

5. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism enables objects to take on multiple forms. It includes method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (subclass provides a specific implementation of a method).

6. **Example (OOP Style):**
   ```java
   // OOP Style
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       int subtract(int a, int b) {
           return a - b;
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
           int num1 = 10;
           int num2 = 5;
           int sum = calculator.add(num1, num2);
           int difference = calculator.subtract(num1, num2);
           System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
           System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
       }
   }
   ```

### Comparison:

- **Data Organization:**
  - Procedural programming organizes data separately from functions, while OOP organizes data and functions together within objects.
- **Code Modularity:**
  - OOP promotes modularity through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more organized, reusable, and maintainable.
- **State Management:**
  - OOP emphasizes managing object states and behaviors, leading to clearer and more structured code compared to global data in procedural programming.
- **Code Complexity:**
  - OOP can handle complex systems more effectively by modeling real-world entities as objects, whereas procedural programming may become complex and harder to manage as the program size increases.
  - Sure, here's a table highlighting the differences between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the context of Java:

| Aspect                       | Procedural Programming                         | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)                   |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus                        | Emphasizes procedures and functions           | Emphasizes objects and their interactions            |
| Data Organization            | Uses simple data structures like arrays        | Organizes data into objects with fields and methods  |
| Code Reusability             | Limited code reusability                       | Promotes code reusability through inheritance        |
| Complexity Management        | May become complex as program grows            | Manages complexity through encapsulation and modularity |
| Encapsulation                | Weak encapsulation, data and functions separate | Strong encapsulation, data and behavior encapsulated within objects |
| Example                      | Example using arrays and functions             | Example using objects and methods                    |
| Maintenance                  | Maintenance can be challenging                 | Easier maintenance with modular, reusable objects    |

This table summarizes the key differences between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, focusing on their approach to data organization, code reusability, complexity management, encapsulation, and maintenance.

Functional programming in Java has become more prominent with the introduction of features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces in Java 8 and later versions. It focuses on composing functions, immutability, and avoiding side effects. On the other hand, OOP in Java emphasizes objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a structured approach to code organization and reuse. Both paradigms have their strengths and are suitable for different types of applications and problem domains.
