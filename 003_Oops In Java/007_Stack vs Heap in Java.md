**Stack vs Heap in Java:**

| Aspect                  | Stack                     | Heap                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**   | Allocates memory for primitives and method calls. | Allocates memory for objects (reference types) and their data. |
| **Default Values**      | Doesn't store default values; variables must be initialized. | Reference types default to null until assigned an object. |
| **Speed**               | Access to stack memory (primitives) is generally faster. | Access to heap memory (objects) is slower due to dynamic allocation. |
| **Storage Location**    | Stores variables in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) manner. | Stores objects dynamically, with more flexibility. |
| **Comparison**          | Primitives compared by their actual values. | Reference types (objects) compared by memory addresses. |
| **Usage**               | Used for method calls and storing primitive data. | Used for storing objects and their data. |
| **Scope**               | Limited to the method or block where variables are declared. | Variables can be accessed globally within their scope. |
| **Life Cycle**          | Variables are created when a method is called and destroyed when the method ends. | Objects persist until no longer referenced, then they are garbage collected. |

**Stack:**
- Used for storing local variables, method calls, and method parameters.
- Memory allocation is straightforward and efficient.
- Variables are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.
- Limited in size and scope, suitable for managing method-level data.

**Heap:**
- Used for storing objects, arrays, and class-level variables (instance and static variables).
- Memory allocation is dynamic and allows for flexible object creation.
- Objects persist until garbage collected, based on their reachability.
- Larger in size compared to the stack, suitable for managing complex data structures and long-term storage.

In summary, the stack is efficient for managing method-level data with a limited scope, while the heap is suitable for storing objects and larger data structures with a longer lifespan. Understanding the differences between stack and heap memory helps in designing efficient and scalable Java applications.
