### Classes in Java:

A class in Java is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors (methods) of objects. Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Definition: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.
2. Purpose: Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on that data.
3. Properties: Classes have instance variables (fields) that represent the state of objects. These variables define the data that objects of the class will hold.
4. Methods: Classes have methods that define behaviors or actions that objects can perform. Methods can manipulate the state of objects and perform various operations.
5. Access Control: Java supports access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to class members.


#### Syntax of a Class:

```java
public class ClassName {
    // Instance variables (properties)
    private int variable1;
    private String variable2;

    // Constructor
    public ClassName(int var1, String var2) {
        this.variable1 = var1;
        this.variable2 = var2;
    }

    // Methods
    public void method1() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    public String method2() {
        // Method implementation
        return someValue;
    }
}
```

- **Instance Variables:** Instance variables are declared within a class but outside any method. They represent the state of an object.

- **Constructor:** Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when an object is created.

- **Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific actions or operations. They operate on the object's data (instance variables).

#### Example of a Class:

```java
public class Car {
    private String brand;
    private int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String brand, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

### Objects in Java:

An object in Java is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or instance with its own set of data and methods.
1. Definition:An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own state and behavior.
2. Creation: Objects are created using the new keyword followed by a class constructor. Each object occupies its own memory space.
3. State: Objects have state, which is defined by the values of their instance variables. Each object can have different state values.
4. Behavior: Objects can perform actions or behaviors defined by the methods of their class. Methods manipulate the object's state and perform operations.

#### Object Creation Process:

1. **Object Creation:** Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by a class constructor.

2. **Memory Allocation:** Memory is allocated on the heap to store the object's data.

3. **Constructor Invocation:** The constructor is called to initialize the object's state.

4. **Reference Return:** The `new` keyword returns a reference (memory address) to the created object.

#### Example of Object Creation:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2022);

        // Call the displayDetails method of the object
        myCar.displayDetails();
    }
}
```

In this example, `myCar` is an object of the `Car` class. We create the object using `new Car("Toyota", 2022);`, which invokes the `Car` constructor to initialize the object's state. We then call the `displayDetails` method of the object to display its details.

### Using Objects:

Once an object is created, we can access its properties (instance variables) and methods using the dot (`.`) operator.

#### Accessing Properties:

```java
String carBrand = myCar.brand;
int carYear = myCar.year;
```

#### Invoking Methods:

```java
myCar.displayDetails();
```

In summary, classes in Java define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects represent specific instances of classes with their own data and methods. Objects are created using constructors and allow us to work with and manipulate data using object-oriented principles.

### Class v/s Object

Here's a tabular comparison between classes and objects in Java:

| Feature          | Classes                                   | Objects                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Definition       | Blueprints/templates for creating objects | Instances of classes with specific data |
| Creation         | Defined using class declarations          | Created using the `new` keyword          |
| Memory Allocation| Do not occupy memory at runtime           | Occupy memory space on the heap         |
| Purpose          | Define properties and behaviors           | Interact with data and perform actions  |
| Usage            | Provide structure for creating objects     | Represent specific instances of classes |
| Scope            | Wider scope                                | Narrower scope                          |
| Relationship     | Hierarchical; inheritance                 | One-to-one with classes                 |
| Examples         | ```java public class Car { ... }```        | ```java Car myCar = new Car();```       |

This table highlights the key differences and similarities between classes and objects in Java, focusing on their definitions, creation, memory allocation, purpose, usage, scope, relationship, and examples.
